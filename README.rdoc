Problems deploying to heroku. All expected functionality works on local server, but when deployed to heroku app has some funky behavior. Idk what the deal is :/

Other than that some problems encountered when deleting a user that has a tasklist. When trying to view the index of tasklists, there is an error because the user that a tasklist belonged to is now deleted.
